I apologize for the inconvience but my make file skills 
were inadequate to meet the assignments requirements. I
have them set up in respective folders so I can fix it 
for the next assignemnt.

However, for the sake of grading
this assignment go to folder all_files and enter the 
following

g++ -Wall -o twitter.cpp twitter

and to run it enter

./twitter "your input file name"
